## How to Use

### Daily Study Sessions

1. Open Claude Code in this repository

3. Answer the comprehension check questions Claude asks
4. After each session, Claude will automatically document:
   - What you learned
   - What you struggled with
   - What you mastered
   - What to review next

### Review Sessions

When you want to review, simply ask Claude:
- "Let's review topics I've struggled with"
- "What should I focus on today?"
- "Quiz me on my weak areas"
- "Show me my progress"

Claude will read your session history and create a personalized review based on your past performance.
