## Questions Asked

### Question 1: Traditional IRA Contribution Limits (Practice Problem)

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about Sharon (age 58, receiving pension, working part-time)

**Problem Details**:
- Sharon: single, age 58
- Retired 2 years ago, receiving $600/month ($7,200/year) pension from qualified pension plan
- New position at CPA firm with no pension plan
- Will earn $5,000/year from CPA firm
- Question: Maximum deductible contribution to traditional IRA for 2024?

**Student's Answer**: Selected B) $0 (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: A) $5,000

**Initial Understanding**: Student was confused about:
- Whether having an existing pension disqualifies IRA contributions
- What qualifies someone to contribute to traditional IRA
- Unclear on earned income vs. pension income distinction

**Explanation Given**:
Covered the core rule: Must have earned income to contribute to IRA. Maximum contribution is lesser of:
1. Earned income for the year
2. IRA limit ($7,000 + $1,000 catch-up for age 50+ = $8,000 in 2024)

Key distinction: Wages/salaries = earned income. Pension/Social Security/investments = NOT earned income.

For Sharon: $5,000 wages (earned) vs $7,200 pension (doesn't count). Max = lesser of $5,000 or $8,000 = $5,000.

**Comprehension Check Questions**:
1. If Sharon earned $10,000, what would max contribution be?
   - Student's answer: $8,000 ✓ CORRECT
   - Reasoning: Earned income ($10,000) exceeds limit ($8,000), so limit wins

2. If Sharon had no job and only pension, could she contribute to IRA?
   - Student's answer: $0 ✓ CORRECT
   - Reasoning: No earned income = no IRA contribution

**Understanding Level**: STRONG - Student correctly applied the "lesser of" rule and understood pension doesn't count as earned income

**Follow-up - Active Participant Rules**:

Student revealed the actual source of confusion: Thought that if new employer had a 401(k), she couldn't deduct IRA contribution - this is why they originally selected $0.

Covered key distinction:
- Contributing to IRA (only needs earned income)
- vs. Deducting IRA contribution (affected by active participant status + income limits)

Active participant phase-out for 2024 (single): $77k-$87k
- Under $77k = full deduction
- Over $87k = no deduction
- But can ALWAYS contribute if have earned income

**Comprehension Check 3**: If Sharon earned $90,000 AND firm had 401(k):
a) Can she contribute to IRA?
b) Can she deduct it?

Student's answers:
- a) Yes, can contribute ✓ CORRECT
- b) No, cannot deduct ✓ CORRECT (income exceeds $87k phase-out)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student now clearly understands contribute vs. deduct distinction

**Follow-up**: Introduced Roth IRA as alternative when traditional IRA isn't deductible

## Key Concepts Covered

**Retirement Accounts:**
- **Traditional IRA Contribution Eligibility**: Must have earned income; max is lesser of earned income or limit ($7k + $1k catch-up)
- **Earned Income Definition**: Wages/salary count; pension/Social Security/investment income don't count
- **Active Participant Rules**: Having employer retirement plan doesn't prevent contribution, only affects deductibility
- **Deduction Phase-out (2024, single, active participant)**: $77k-$87k
- **Roth IRA Alternative**: Better than non-deductible traditional IRA when can't deduct (tax-free vs tax-deferred growth)

**Retirement Plan Classifications:**
- **Classification System #1 - DC vs DB**: Based on what's defined and who bears investment risk
  - Defined Contribution: Contribution is known, benefit unknown. Employee bears investment risk.
  - Defined Benefit: Benefit is promised, contribution varies. Employer bears investment risk.
- **Classification System #2 - Pension vs Profit-Sharing**: Based on contribution requirements
  - Pension Plans: Mandatory, fixed contributions
  - Profit-Sharing Plans: Discretionary, flexible contributions
- **Tricky Plans**:
  - Cash Balance Plan: DB (despite showing account balance, employer bears all investment risk)
  - Target Benefit Plan: DC (targets a benefit but doesn't guarantee it)
  - Money Purchase Pension: DC plan with mandatory contributions (pension type)

**Investment Risk:**
- **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: = correlation². Represents % of systematic risk
- **Systematic Risk**: Market risk, cannot be diversified away. Measured by R²
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Company-specific risk, can be diversified away. Formula: 1 - R²
- **Correlation = 1.0**: Pure market exposure (like index funds), 100% systematic risk, 0% unsystematic
- **Higher correlation**: More systematic risk, less diversification benefit

**Short Selling & Options:**
- **Short Selling Stock**: Borrow shares → Sell → Buy back lower → Return shares. Unlimited risk, no expiration
- **Buying Put Options**: Limited risk (premium only), has expiration, better for timing-specific bearish bets
- **When to use Short Selling**: Bearish with uncertain timeline (can hold indefinitely)
- **When to use Puts**: Bearish with timing confidence (short-term bets)
- **Key difference**: Short selling = unlimited losses; Put options = limited loss to premium

**Nondiscrimination Testing:**
- **HCE Definition**: 5% owner OR compensation > $155,000 (2024)
- **Ratio Percentage Test**: (% non-HCEs covered) ÷ (% HCEs covered) ≥ 70%
- **Average Benefits Test**: (Avg non-HCE benefit) ÷ (Avg HCE benefit) ≥ 70%
- **Purpose**: Ensure qualified plans don't unfairly favor highly compensated employees

**Estate Planning & Probate:**
- **Probate Process**: Court-supervised collection of assets, payment of debts, distribution per will/state law
- **Goes Through Probate**: Solely-owned property, tenants in common property, life insurance payable to estate
- **Avoids Probate**: Beneficiary designations (to persons), JTWROS, trusts, TOD/POD accounts
- **Life Insurance Beneficiaries**:
  - To person → Avoids probate
  - To estate → Goes through probate (used for estate liquidity, by mistake, or when no close family)
- **JTWROS (Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship)**: Passes automatically to surviving owner, avoids probate
- **Tenants in Common**: Your share goes through probate (no automatic transfer to co-owner)

### Question 2: Systematic vs Unsystematic Risk Calculation

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about Portfolio A with standard deviation 12%, market SD 16%, correlation 0.5. What % is unsystematic risk?

**Student's Answer**: Selected A) 50% (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: C) 75%

**Initial Understanding**:
- Good conceptual understanding: knows systematic vs unsystematic risk definitions
- Understood diversification reduces unsystematic risk
- Did NOT know the mathematical calculation
- Correctly identified that standard deviations were irrelevant information

**Explanation Given**:
Formula for unsystematic risk:
1. Calculate R² = (correlation coefficient)²
2. R² = systematic risk %
3. Unsystematic risk = 1 - R²

For this problem:
- R² = 0.5² = 0.25 (25% systematic)
- Unsystematic = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 (75%)

Student likely chose 50% by using correlation directly instead of squaring it.

**Comprehension Check Questions**:

1. If correlation = 0.80, what % is unsystematic risk?
   - Student's answer: 1 - 0.8² = 0.36 or 36% ✓ CORRECT
   - Applied formula perfectly

2. If correlation = 1.0, what % is unsystematic risk, and what does this mean practically?
   - Student's answer: 0% ✓ CORRECT
   - Explanation: "Like investing the whole market, literally a duplicate of S&P 500" ✓ EXCELLENT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from zero knowledge of the formula to complete mastery in minutes. Strong conceptual and mathematical understanding.

**Key Insight**: Student asked great clarifying question about whether standard deviations mattered - correctly identified they were red herrings for this specific question.

### Question 3: Retirement Plan Classifications

**Student's Question**: Conceptual discussion - "I remember there are two ways of splitting retirement plans: defined contribution vs defined benefit, and profit sharing vs pension. Is this correct?"

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew there were two classification systems
- Understood defined benefit correctly (benefit amount is promised)
- MISUNDERSTOOD defined contribution: thought it meant employer could choose whether to contribute
- Correctly suspected profit sharing vs pension was a separate classification

**Explanation Given**:

**Classification System #1: Defined Contribution vs Defined Benefit**
- DC: Contribution amount is known, benefit amount is unknown (depends on investment performance)
- DB: Benefit amount is promised, contribution amount varies (whatever is needed to fund the promise)
- Key: Who bears investment risk? DC = employee, DB = employer

**Classification System #2: Pension Plans vs Profit-Sharing Plans**
- Pension Plans: Mandatory, fixed contribution requirements
- Profit-Sharing Plans: Discretionary/flexible contributions

**Tricky Plans Discussed**:
- **Cash Balance Plan**: LOOKS like DC (shows account balance) but is actually DB (employer bears investment risk, promises specific credits/returns)
- **Target Benefit Plan**: DC plan that aims for a target benefit but doesn't guarantee it
- **Money Purchase Pension Plan**: DC plan with mandatory contributions (pension type, but DC classification)

**Comprehension Checks**:

1. Classification of 401(k):
   - System #1: Defined Contribution ✓
   - System #2: Profit-Sharing ✓

2. Why is Cash Balance Plan defined benefit?
   - Student's answer: "Employer takes all the risk. They credit you 5% no matter the market result. The money showing makes you feel happy but it's actually a defined benefit" ✓ EXCELLENT

3. Why is Target Benefit Plan defined contribution?
   - Student's answer: "It's called target benefit, not defined benefit. It gives guidance about contributions to reach the goal, but if investments underperform, you don't get the target" ✓ CORRECT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student had the framework mostly correct and quickly grasped the nuances of tricky plans like Cash Balance and Target Benefit.

### Question 4: Short Selling vs Options (Terminology Clarification)

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about short selling - got it right (D: benefit from decline) but wanted to clarify terminology

**Initial Understanding**:
- Strong understanding of options (call vs put, long vs short positions)
- **CONFUSION**: Thought "short selling" was related to options terminology
- Thought "sell = short" in options context
- Did not understand mechanics of short selling stock

**Explanation Given**:

**Short Selling Stock (NOT options):**
1. Borrow shares from broker
2. Sell borrowed shares at current price
3. Wait for price to drop
4. Buy back shares at lower price
5. Return shares to broker
6. Profit = sell price - buy price

**Key characteristics:**
- Unlimited loss potential (stock can rise infinitely)
- No expiration date (can hold indefinitely)
- Costs: borrowing fees, dividends, margin requirements
- No premium to enter position

**Buying Put Options (comparison):**
- Limited loss (only premium paid)
- Has expiration date (time decay)
- Better for short-term bearish bets with certain timing
- Pay premium upfront

**Common Misconception Corrected:**
Student initially thought when you buy a put and stock rises, you lose both the price difference AND premium.
✗ Wrong: Loss = $50 + $2 premium
✓ Correct: Loss = ONLY $2 premium (maximum loss is always just the premium)

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. If you short sell at $50 and stock rises to $100, what's your loss?
   - Student's answer: $50 loss ✓ CORRECT

2. If you buy a put for $2 premium and stock rises to $100, what's your loss?
   - Student's initial answer: $52 ✗ INCORRECT
   - After correction: Understood max loss is only $2 premium ✓

3. Why would someone short sell instead of buying puts?
   - Student initially didn't know
   - After explanation: "Short selling is for when you don't have a date confidence" ✓ EXCELLENT INSIGHT

4. When would you use puts vs short selling for bearish bet?
   - Student's answer: "Long put when you have a date confidence, short selling when you don't have date confidence" ✓ PERFECT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from confusing short selling with options terminology to fully understanding the mechanics, risk profiles, and appropriate use cases for each strategy.

**Key Insight**: Student made excellent connection that short selling = indefinite timeline, puts = specific timeline/timing confidence.

### Question 5: Nondiscrimination Testing - Ratio Percentage Test

**Student's Question**: Beauty Co. pension plan problem - 20 HCEs (16 covered), 180 non-HCEs (125 covered). HCE avg benefit 8%, non-HCE avg benefit 3%.

**Student's Answer**: Selected B) Plan doesn't meet ratio percentage test but meets average benefits test (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: C) Plan meets ratio percentage test

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew nondiscrimination testing exists for qualified plans
- Knew definition of HCE (5% owner or $155k+ salary)
- Knew there are Ratio Percentage Test and Average Benefits Test
- **Did NOT remember the specific formulas or calculations**
- Found problem "very hard" due to all the numbers

**Explanation Given**:

**Ratio Percentage Test Formula:**
1. Calculate % HCEs covered
2. Calculate % non-HCEs covered
3. Divide: (non-HCE %) ÷ (HCE %)
4. Must be ≥ 70% to pass

**Average Benefits Test Formula:**
- (Average non-HCE benefit) ÷ (Average HCE benefit) ≥ 70%

**Student's Calculation (done independently):**
- HCE coverage: 16/20 = 80% ✓
- Non-HCE coverage: 125/180 = 69.5% ✓
- Ratio: 69.5/80 = 87% ✓
- Conclusion: 87% ≥ 70%, so PASSES ✓ PERFECT

Average Benefits check:
- 3% ÷ 8% = 37.5%
- 37.5% < 70%, so FAILS

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Once shown the formula structure, student calculated correctly and understood immediately. The issue was not remembering the specific formulas, not the ability to apply them.

**Key Insight**: Student selected answer saying "doesn't pass" even though their own math proved it passes - suggests lack of confidence in their calculations or test anxiety.

### Question 6: Probate Estate - Life Insurance Payable to Estate

**Student's Question**: What property is included in probate estate? Problem included: (1) solely-owned securities, (2) tenants in common, (3) life insurance payable to estate, (4) JTWROS condo with spouse.

**Student's Answer**: Selected C) 1 and 2 (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: A) 1, 2, and 3

**Initial Understanding**:
- Good basic understanding: probate is for property without clear beneficiary
- Correctly identified physical property (houses) often goes through probate
- Correctly understood bank accounts/stocks with beneficiaries avoid probate
- **CONFUSION**: Didn't understand "life insurance payable to estate" concept
- Key question: "What does it mean life insurance payable to decedent's estate? Can I be the beneficiary? Can my estate be the beneficiary?"

**Explanation Given**:

**Probate Process:**
- Court-supervised process to collect assets, pay debts, distribute remainder
- Goes through probate: Solely-owned property, tenants in common
- Avoids probate: Beneficiary designations, JTWROS, trusts, TOD/POD accounts

**Life Insurance Beneficiaries:**
- Normal: Beneficiary = person (spouse, kids) → Avoids probate
- Special case: Beneficiary = "Estate" → GOES THROUGH PROBATE
- Cannot name yourself as beneficiary (you're dead when it pays)
- Can name estate as beneficiary (though usually not ideal)

**Why name estate as beneficiary?**
1. **Intentional - Estate liquidity**: Pay estate taxes/debts when assets are illiquid (e.g., $10M business, $3M tax bill, need insurance cash to avoid fire sale)
2. **By mistake**: Named beneficiary died, forgot to update, defaults to estate
3. **No close family**: Easier to distribute to multiple distant relatives through will

**For CFP Exam:**
- Life insurance → person = Avoids probate
- Life insurance → estate = Goes through probate

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student understood the concept once explained. The confusion was about the practical application of naming estate as beneficiary, not the probate mechanics.

**Key Insight**: Student asked excellent practical question: "Who does that for what?" Shows desire to understand real-world application, not just memorize rules.
